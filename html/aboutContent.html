        As a recent BCIT Computer Systems Technology graduate I am eager to begin my career in the software industry. 
        I've acquired experience in object-oriented languages like C# and Java from both a formal education and my own passion for developing software projects.

        Currently I am exploring data-oriented design for video games as well as diving back into HTML to make this website.
